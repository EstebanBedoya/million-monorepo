# Code Comments Guidelines

## Avoid Unnecessary Comments
- Do NOT add obvious comments like `// View Details Button (optional)` or `// Get user data`
- Do NOT comment every line or simple operations
- Do NOT add comments that just repeat what the code does

## When to Add Comments
Only add comments for:
- Complex business logic that isn't immediately obvious
- Non-obvious algorithms or mathematical operations
- Workarounds for external library limitations
- Performance optimizations that might seem counterintuitive
- Complex regular expressions or string manipulations
- Integration points with external systems

## Comment Style
- Use JSDoc format for function documentation: `/** */`
- Write comments in English
- Focus on the "why" not the "what"
- Keep comments concise and meaningful

## Examples of BAD comments:
```typescript
// Get the user
const user = getUser();

// Check if user exists
if (user) {
  // Return user data
  return user;
}
```

## Examples of GOOD comments:
```typescript
/**
 * Calculates compound interest using the formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
 * @param principal - Initial amount
 * @param rate - Annual interest rate
 * @param time - Time in years
 * @param compoundFrequency - Number of times interest compounds per year
 */
function calculateCompoundInterest(principal: number, rate: number, time: number, compoundFrequency: number): number {
  // Using Math.pow for precision with large numbers
  return principal * Math.pow(1 + rate / compoundFrequency, compoundFrequency * time);
}
```
